### F19 — End-to-end correlation IDs (Python-side)

**Fix.** Added `cortex/libs/logging/correlation.py` with a `ContextVar`-backed correlation id, `correlation_scope` context manager, and a stdlib `logging.Filter` that injects the id onto every record. Wired `structlog.contextvars.merge_contextvars` into the structlog processor chain so any code path that calls `get_logger()` automatically gets `correlation_id=...` in its log records. Added a FastAPI middleware that mints or accepts `X-Cortex-Request-ID` per request, binds it for the request lifetime, and echoes it back on the response. The WebSocket server enters a correlation scope around every inbound message and stamps the active id onto outbound messages in `_broadcast` so daemon-initiated traffic (state updates, intervention triggers) carries the originating request's id. The Anthropic planner's `llm.request status=ok` log line now includes `cid=…` so cost telemetry (F20, next) can group spend by request.

**Files touched** (7):
- `cortex/libs/logging/correlation.py` (new)
- `cortex/libs/logging/structured.py`
- `cortex/libs/logging/__init__.py`
- `cortex/services/api_gateway/app.py`
- `cortex/services/api_gateway/websocket_server.py`
- `cortex/services/llm_engine/anthropic_planner.py`
- `cortex/tests/integration/test_correlation_ids.py` (new test)

**Test.** `cortex/tests/integration/test_correlation_ids.py` — 8 cases. Asserts the contextvar round-trips, nests correctly, the HTTP middleware mints when absent and echoes when supplied, and `_broadcast` stamps the active id onto a `WSMessage` that arrived with `correlation_id=None`. All 8 pass on this branch; on `main` (pre-fix) the imports `from cortex.libs.logging.correlation import ...` resolve to ModuleNotFoundError, the middleware doesn't exist (no `X-Cortex-Request-ID` header in response), and `_broadcast` does not stamp ids — every test fails.

**Verification.**
- F19 suite: `pytest cortex/tests/integration/test_correlation_ids.py` → 8 passed (0.64s).
- Regression check: `pytest cortex/tests/unit/test_api_gateway.py cortex/tests/unit/test_anthropic_planner.py` → 56 passed (11.51s).

**Compatibility.** Additive only. The middleware adds one header to every response; the WS envelope's `correlation_id` field already existed and was optional. No schema changes, no migrations, no client-side coordination required. Stale clients that don't propagate the id continue to work — they get a freshly-minted id per inbound message.

**Rollback.** `git revert` of this commit is clean: no DB or cache state; the contextvar dies with the process; the middleware is added in code only.

**Scope split.** The browser-extension half of correlation propagation (popup `→` background `→` daemon round-trip) is filed as new Ledger entry **F19b** in `New Findings` below; closing it depends on F40 (TS test infra). Daemon-internal traceability — which is what F19 promised — is closed.

## New Findings (surfaced during Phase 2)

### F19b — Correlation IDs in browser extension

**Summary.** F19 closed daemon-internal correlation. The browser extension (`background.ts`, `popup.tsx`, `newtab.tsx`) still does not mint a correlation id at the user-action origin, does not include it in outbound WS messages, and does not log it. End-to-end traceability from popup click → daemon → LLM → response is therefore one hop short of complete.
**Location.** `cortex/apps/browser_extension/background.ts:1383,1391` (correlation_id forwarded if present but never logged or minted), `cortex/apps/browser_extension/popup.tsx` (no minting).
**Category.** Cross / UI.
**Blast radius.** maintainability + correctness.
**Fix complexity.** S, but **depends on F40** (no TS test infra to verify).
**Dependencies.** F19 (closed), F40 (no TS tests).
**Why split.** Touching the TS side without F40's test infra means manual UI verification only — violates the Phase-2 quality bar requiring a failing-on-main test. Filed as deferred; will be picked up immediately after F40.
